# EventProject

<<<<<<< HEAD
Our team's name is M2V and our team leader is Milen.
The members of the team are Milen Rabadzhiev, Vanina Panova and Maria Dineva.
Our project is going to be about creating, displaying, searching and deleting events of four types - music, culture, sport and business. They are going to be divided into past, current and future events.
We are going to have a pre-prepared database. Each event is going to have the
following features: id, title, description, type, picture, location, date/time.
